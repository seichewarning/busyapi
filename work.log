- inspect the project

- use aws, get familar with new tools

- decide on persistent key-value db, think learning, setup, config,
  scaling, throughput, cli, testing, running locally...

  NO  - redis, fast but not familiar with persistence setup
  NO  - mongoDB, what Propeller uses, fast, but too complicated for this
        and setup/config too time consuming on AWS
  NO  - rocksDB, super fast, cons similar to mongoDB
  YES - dynamoDB, native aws tool, scalable, small learning curve

- load testing...
   Just use Artillery, versatile, pretty straight forward, possible
   Lambda integration, easy.

- decide on building blocks
  Option 1:
    - Fastify instead Express
    - Elastic Load Balancer
    - Simple scaling create bunch of beefy instances
    PROS: long term solution with more control once functional
          requirements figured out, versatile for change
    CONS: too many moving parts to get working in 2 hours given
          simple explicit requirements.  Might rack up a big bill
          if not careful

  Option 2:
    - AWS Lambda with Node.js
    PROS: quick, tons of info, easy scaling and testing, more
          configuration than programming
    CONS: haven't used it yet, might rack up a big bill if not 
          careful, more configuration than programming


- Going with OPTION 2!
  - play around and get super basic lambda function working
  - get dynamoDB creating Items for request
  - figure out table structure, just use uuid as sorting index
    assuming many creates per patient


- strip anything unessecary from busyapi
  - remove it all and re-npm init
  - get writeUsage lambda function working

- get work flow going, zipping project, uploading, testing.
  not going to worry about efficient deployment process right
  now, one off proof of concept

- try out local dynamoDB, get familiar
** java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
** aws dynamodb --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000 describe-table --table-name Usages

- don't even need express server for lambda, hope it's not cheating...

** zip -r ../busyapi.zip *

- lambda role, make admin, refine later if time.
- create lambda test using readme json

- not going to worry too much about error handling right now, will
  if there's enough time.

- deal with lambda config minutiae
- fix sloppy mistakes from strip out
- almost tempted to figure out aws cli instead of using web interface..
- looked into aws serverless np, but spent too much time
- set TABLE_NAME key/value in lambda config

- got test working with Item in db, but no return id, figure out..
  use callback spit back json

- just checked in code, work on load testing
- yikes, need to figure out api gateway....
  - create api and usages resources along
  - create post method on usages
- api test works but need to fix returned uuid, always the same...
  (or perhaps it was my imagination since last few chars the same)

- create ad-hoc testing stage, have url to hit locally now
  - https://1zszg024ci.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/testing
  - curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"patientId":"100","timestamp":"Tue Nov 01 2016 09:11:51 GMT-0500 (CDT)","medication":"Albuterol"}' https://1zszg024ci.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/testing/api/usages

- curl returning properly and data being inserted into db, now ready
  for load testing... try locally first, will add config file but not
  save package in order to reduce size.
